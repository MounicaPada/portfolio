    <p class = "indent">From Bill Gates to Elon Musk, they all have one
thing in common regardless of their different platforms. They all have built
successful companies. Following in their footsteps, my goal is to also establish
a globalwide software company. In order to achieve this goal, I would like to
start off by building a software prototype for the community, then incrementaly enhance it to a
larger scale. The precise product strategy for this company has not yet been completely defined,
but I would like it to be shaped as a technological company serving communities. Living in the
Silicon Valley, I was surrounded by numerous startups, which worked in my
advantage. I was exposed to the software field at a very young age, since my father is a software
engineer himself.  My passion has been kick-started by my father's enthusiasm
towards programming. To develop my skills , I have learned HTML,CSS, and Python. To further enrich
my domain knowledge in computer science,
I would like to complete 
my education in computer science from reputeable universities. I have a striving passion for engineering,
specifically towards the software side. The software field has captivated me from a very young
age, I grew up idolizing CEO's of software companies, specifically Bill Gates
, Larry Page, Sergey Brin, Steve Jobs and Mark Zuckerberg. These people have
made such a significant impact in my life and so many others. </p>

<p class = "indent"> I am an extremely hard work and determined student. This is
shown both in school and extracurriculars. If I am not confident in a certain topic
in math class, I work until I have mastered it. In other instances
like dance class if I don't have a certain step down, I practice until it is corrected.
My leadership skills shine through in group projects, in times of crisis,
and extracurriculars. In a team, I drive and influence my team's
decisions. I make sure I keep an open-mind and am willing to learn from others. Along with leadership skills, I always try to be optimistic even in
the most devastating situations. To the most part I am methodical but I do not mind
take a few risks. My methodical approach is very effective when coding long sequences
and projects. My fun,energetic, and bubbly personality lights up any situation. My perseverance
will help with difficult errors or glitches in my software/code. </p>

<p class = "indent">In freshman year, I participated in the science fair with
an arduino based water moisture sensor(to learn more about this project
click the projects tab). With this project, I won 4th place in the engineering category. In addition, I also assist
students in another club called Code Dojo. In addition, I also am an intern at the Lawrence Hall of Science, where I teach children
engineering concepts.
Both activities have an excellent reputation inside and outside of
the Bay Area.  I am the president of the Girls Excelling in Math and Science Club (GEMS)
at my school and am  
part of the Youth Advisory Committee for the 2017-2018 school year. In the Girls Excelling in Math and Science Club,
we plan to fundraise money for an underprivileged school in the Bay Area. In addition, I am also
an engineering academy student in my school. The academy guides students through a 
specific pathway according to their engineering interests.I have been participating 
in a classical Indian art form called Kuchipudi. From being in these multiple clubs, I have
learned to work with different types of people, apply problem-solving skills, and enhance my 
public speaking skills have 
improved. Teaching students in Coder Dojo has taught me to look and learn in other's point of view. 
While working on a project with new girls has taught me practical approaches to influence and guide the team. 
Leading my own club has taught me perseverance and management. Learning dance from a young age
has taught me discipline and self-control. Dance has also taught me how to stay calm in
stressful situations. </p>

<p class = "indent">As senior year comes to an end,  I have decided to continue my education at UC Santa Cruz as a Computer Engineering major. I am excited to see what path 
I take in the future.
Overall,my experiences with coding,dancing and school have taught me many skills
, which I still use today.  I invite you to learn more about my projects and my work experience(click on the projects tab or the the resume tab).
