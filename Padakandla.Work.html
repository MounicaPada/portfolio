<p style = "font-size:20px" class = "indent">I spent my summer interning at the Ingenuity Lab at the Lawrence Hall of Science in Berkeley,CA. During this internship, I taught young children engineering concepts through projects and activities. Through this experience, I was able to gain more patience and learn how to tolerate different behaviors. I was also inspired to create my own club that assists underprivileged schools in the Bay Area. By meeting different people with various backgrounds, I was able to understand the circumstances of underprivileged and low-income families in the Bay Area. I wanted to be able to help those in need through education. I also participated in the Lawrence Hall of Science’s Ingenuity Lab’s workshop where I contributed to the improvement of the Ingenuity Lab’s educational material and resources. I also received an award for my excellent public relations at the Hall.

   <p style = "font-size:20px" class = "indent">In addition, I am also planning the Tri-Valley Youth Expo with several other high school students. The Tri-Valley Youth Expo will serve as an exposition of the arts and culture of the youth in the Tri-Valley. It will be a showcase of the best and the greatest of what youth in the Tri-Valley are able to offer. The Expo will bring together a sense of community, a sense of creativity and passion within the youth community of the Tri-Valley. The Expo will be a multidimensional event, combining together culture, the youth, the arts, and coding into one event.

<p style = "font-size:20px" class = "indent">One of the most influential guest speakers we have had for me is Danielle Demmon. I was able to gain the experience of tackling a new language and experimenting with it. Coding is a passion of mine and to get introduced to a new language sparked curiosity to learn more languages. Another significant speaker was Maynard Holiday. Maynard Holiday initiated my interest in robotics and nuclear power. His presentation on chernobyl prompted to research more into a career like his. I have also been able to gain insight on starting a company from my mentor, Jason Franco. Through the engineering academy, I am able to learn more about creating a successful company and kickstarting my career. My mentor has not only given me information on starting a company but also advice on how to begin my professional career early.

<p style = "font-size:20px" class = "indent">Through the engineering academy, I have been able to tour 
a few colleges in the Bay Area. I was able to experience and gain 
knowledge on University of California, Berkeley (my dream college). 
This opportunity has given more information on the environment of a college. 
I was also able to visit the University of San Francisco, which demonstrated the
importance of selecting colleges based on their individual departments.  I have completed my mentorship program with the Engineering Academy this year. I gained 
so much knowledge on the software field and starting your own buisness through this amazing program.My menor, Jason Franco guided 
me and helped me with achieving my dreams. Overall,
I have been able to experience many opportunities related my interests and career.
